# Death Penalty Data Analysis

The files attached present a death penalty prediction model built with MATLAB. I found a database through Google and converted it into an Excel file. In section one of "finalexecutions.m", I used MATLAB code to clean the data. In section two of "finalexecutions.m", I summarized and visualized death penalty execution results by race, gender, and age. In section three of "finalexecutions.m", I visualized the correlations between execution methods and identity characteristics. In section four of "finalexecutions.m", I made a Geo Map to illustrate the prevalence of execution across the United States. In section five of "finalexecutions.m", I wrote a series of conditionals to predict the likelihood of execution by the death penalty based on age, gender, and race. 

This project was completed as part of the Intro to Computing course at Tufts University.
